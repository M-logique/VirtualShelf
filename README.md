## Description 🌟

VirtualShelf is a **library management system** developed using **C++** and **Go**. The application provides functionalities for adding books, managing student records, and handling book borrowings. It's designed to work on multiple platforms, including Linux, macOS, and Windows, because we believe **everyone** should have access to a library (whether they're on a PC, Mac, or even a toaster). 🍞

The application supports the following architectures:

- **Linux**: amd64, arm64
- **Darwin (macOS)**: arm64
- **Windows**: amd64

Built using **CMake** and **Python** for the build process, and **SQLite** for data storage (because who doesn’t love SQL?!). 😎
